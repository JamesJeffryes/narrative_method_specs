    In this app, the user provides an existing model and a new genome.
    The original model is translated to the new input genome based on bi-directional best hits.

    The model translation app requires a model and genome as input, and optionally can take a
    media formulation as input. It's possible you have already loaded your objects into KBase.
    In that case, use the widgets below to transfer the objects into the workspace selected for
    this app. Otherwise, use the widget below to upload your objects into KBase.

description : |
    <p>The "Propagate Genome-scale Model to Close Genome" app allows an existing genome-scale model of a reference genome to be translated to a new model of a close genome. This is advantageous because the model being translated may include extensive manual curation, and it is often faster to translate an existing curated model to a new genome rather than building a new model of the genome from scratch. The user must select the model to be translated, as well as the genome to which the model will be propagated. Propagation is based on bidirectional best hits between the original model genome and the genome selected by the user for propagation. The resultant model will then be gapfilled by KBase in any growth condition selected by the user. The metabolic model object produced by this app may be exported in SBML or Excel format or immediately used as input in any of the downstream modeling apps.</p>
