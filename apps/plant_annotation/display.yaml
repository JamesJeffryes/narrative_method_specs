description : |
    <p>The "Annotate Plant Transcripts" app performs functional annotation of plant cDNA or protein sequences. The input FASTA file should contain cDNA sequences (obtained from assembling transcripts from NGS of a transcriptome) or translated protein sequences from plant gene models. KBase assigns metabolic functions (derived from the PlantSEED Subsystems ontology) to the sequences. The resulting annotated genome can be exported in GenBank format or used as input to other KBase apps such as Plant Genome to Metabolic Model to FBA. This app is similar to the Microbial Genome Annotation/Reannotation app but uses annotation approaches and ontologies that are optimized for plant genomes rather than microbial genomes.</p>
