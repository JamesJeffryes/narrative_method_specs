description : |
    <p>The "Run Flux Balance Analysis" app enables users to construct a model of how metabolites flow through the metabolic network of an organism. The user starts by either uploading a model into KBase in SBML format, or selecting an existing model constructed by KBase. KBase will then simulate flux balance analysis with the model, enabling a wide range of custom FBA algorithms, including flux variability analysis, knockout of all individual genes, fitting to expression data, and Probabilistic Regulation of Metabolism (PROM). This app produces an FBA object, which may be exported in Excel or SBML format.</p>
