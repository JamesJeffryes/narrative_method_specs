description : |
    <p>The "Simulate and Reconcile Growth Phenotypes" app predicts phenotypic characteristics of an organism based on a set of model conditions. To begin, the user uploads a table of phenotype data (e.g., Biolog or gene essentiality data) into the app. The user also either uploads a metabolic model or selects a model already present in KBase. KBase uses the selected model to simulate the uploaded phenotypes, presenting simulation results in a detailed exportable report. This app also conducts some reconciliation of models with phenotype data.</p>
