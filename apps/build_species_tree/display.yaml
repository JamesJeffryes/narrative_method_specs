    step_1 : |
        Construct a species tree containing all genomes in the supplied genome set
    step_2 : |
        Build a new genome set containing all genomes included in the species tree

    <p>The "Insert Genomes into Species Tree" app allows a user to determine evolutionary relationships between organisms based on the differences in their genomes. In this app, the user may either upload a set of genomes into KBase or select from an existing set of genomes already in KBase. KBase will then recruit these genomes into a species tree. KBase will also select a specified number of phylogenetically close genomes from the KBase reference genome database to also include in the tree. The tree object may be exported or viewed in KBase.</p>
