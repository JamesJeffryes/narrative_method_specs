    <p>The Reconstruct Community Metabolic Model app generates a community model to be used with model-associated apps in KBase (e.g., Flux Balance Analysis, Growth Phenotype Simulation and Reconciliation) to predict flux and interactions between species in the community. To begin, the user may either upload a set of metabolic models or select a set of metabolic models already present in KBase. KBase will then assemble these models into a single compartmentalized microbial community model. The user may also select or upload a growth condition to which the community model will be gap filled.</p>
