name     : Build Plant Metabolic Model and Run FBA
subtitle : |
    Starting with an Annotated Genome object containing plant transcripts, build a metabolic model and add reactions until the model can predict growth.
tooltip  : |
    In this App, you can build a model for a genome and gapfill it.

    <p>The "Build Plant Metabolic Model and Run FBA" app generates a metabolic model for a plant and then runs FBA on the model. The user begins by supplying an annotated Genome object derived either from another KBase app (Plant Transcript Sequences to Annotated Genome) or from the collection of annotated Genome objects pre-loaded in KBase. A metabolic model is generated from the PlantSEED metabolic annotation in the Genome object. It is gap filled and run through Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). The user can then visualize the model and export (as SBML) both the model and the FBA results.</p>
