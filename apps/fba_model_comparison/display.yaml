    <p>The "Compare Two Metabolic Models" app enables the user to view the similarities and differences between metabolic models of selected genomes. To begin, the user may either upload a set of metabolic models in Excel or SBML format or select a set of metabolic models already present in KBase. KBase will then conduct a side-by-side comparison of the models, presenting a detailed exportable report to the user.</p>
