name     : GWAS Variation To Genes
subtitle : This method takes the top SNPs obtained after GWAS analysis as input (TopVariations) object, -log (pvalue) cutoff and a distance parameter as input. For each significant SNP that passes the p-value cutoff, genes are searched in the window specified by the distance parameter.
