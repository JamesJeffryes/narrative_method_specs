    <p>This method allows you to take a microbial genome sequence and place it in a species tree.  You have the option
    of selecting the number of closest genomes to consider.</p>
    
    <p>The method operates by first identifying the closest genomes and identifying 49 highly-conserved
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/">COG</a> families.  These families are used to construct an alignment
    and <a href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/">fast tree</a> is used to build the species tree.
    </p>
    
    <p>The resulting species tree is displayed and saved to your workspace</p>
